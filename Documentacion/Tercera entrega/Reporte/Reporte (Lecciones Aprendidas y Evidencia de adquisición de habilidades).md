## Throughout the project we have learned to use different tools such as:

* **Monday.com**

It is a project management tool that allows organizations to manage tasks, projects and teamwork. We chose this tool for the following reasons:

1. Its ease of use it is an application that stores information in a very graphical way and it is very easy to create, store and assign new tasks

2. Is free,Monday is a paid tool that has a free plan that is enough for what we are going to do

3. Graphs and statistics Monday has graphs and statistics with which we can more easily track the progress of our project in real-time

[This is the link to our Monday board](https://uady-cast.monday.com/boards/841731238/)

On Monday we have sprints and backlog, when we are going to start a sprint, each one drags tasks from the backlog to the corresponding sprint, and we put who is doing them. Once we start to move forward we change the status of the task to "In progress" and when we finish the task we change its status to "Ready".

* **Teams and WhatsApp**

1. **Teams**

We use Teams is an application that has functionalities for calls, screen sharing, messages, meetings, call scheduling and channel creation.

2. **WhatsApp**

We use WhatsApp because it is a very practical application to send instant messages is very popular, which is why all of the team members have it.<br>
When someone has a question, he communicates it through the WhatsApp group and the other members of the team answer his questions. Sometimes we have unplanned meetings and we communicate them through whatsApp.<br>
When an agreement has to be taken, but it is not long or complex enough for a call through teams, we take it through WhatsApp.

* **GitHub**

We use Github as the basis of our repository, as it allows us to work with separate branches and avoid conflicts in research. Each person has their individual branch, which starts from the DEV branch, which is a sub-branch of the main. Where each person makes their contribution to the investigation and at the end a pull request is created to the dev branch, where the Product Owner verifies the compatibility between branches, and ends with a merge towards the main branch.

We have also learned to use **"Alexa Developer Console"** where we are programming the skill, this skill is made with the JavaScript language, some of us had to learn the language, but those who focused on programming, already mastered said language.
